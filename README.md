# Sup, My name is [Rik](https://www.rikdenbreejen.nl/)! 🖐

I am Rik den Breejen, a Software engineer from the Netherlands. My specialization is predominantly in web-development, ranging from front- to back-end. 
Currently I attend Fontys University of Applied Sciences, majoring in Software engineering. 

My love for coding drives me to spend a lot of my free time programming on personal projects. I often find myself experimenting with and geeking out over new technologies.

## 🛠 I am working on [React Blend](https://github.com/Rikthepixel/react-blend)

A blend of useful higher order components (hocs) and hooks. Sounds odd, right? [Who even uses higher order components!](https://github.com/Rikthepixel/react-blend?tab=readme-ov-file#why-still-use-higher-order-components) Regardless, it's a neat project that would help developers make applications faster in the future!
