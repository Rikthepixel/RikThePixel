# Sup, My name is Rik! 🖐

I am a 4rd year Software Engineering student at Hogeschool Fontys in the Netherlands.

## 🛠 I am working on

### Making a federated Facebook Marketplace clone

MarketSquare is a Open-source federated marketplace. MarketSquare will be federated just like Mastodon. Which means that you can spin up your own instance and communicate with others.
