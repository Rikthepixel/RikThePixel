# Sup, My name is [Rik](https://www.rikdenbreejen.nl/)! 🖐

I am Rik den Breejen, a Software engineer from the Netherlands. My specialization is predominantly in web-development, ranging from front- to back-end. 
I work for [TinyTronics](https://github.com/TinyTronics). I graduated from Fontys University of Applied Sciences, majoring in Software engineering. 

My love for coding drives me to spend a lot of my free time programming on personal projects. I often find myself experimenting with and geeking out over new technologies.

## ❤️⚒️ I am working on [Termz](https://github.com/Rikthepixel/termz)

> **Setup terminals on your own terms.**

Termz is a tool that automatally sets up terminal sessions. It already does so much! It opens your tabs, runs your scripts, sets the working directory. Best of all it is cross-platform. Currently Windows terminal and VSCode (and derivatives) are supported, with plans to expand other terminal applications like konsole, but also multiplexers like tmux.

Documentation will be worked on soon.
